# Desktop icon spacing

[简体中文](DesktopIcons.zh-CN.md)

Right-click the desktop background and choose icon spacing: loose, compact or tighter.
Spacing is independent of icon size, display scaling and files. Labels keep at most two lines,
using actual font height. The preference is `DesktopFiles/iconSpacing` in
`deskcenter-desktop-files.ini`; old configurations default to loose.

For AI contributors: `DesktopGridMetrics.mjs` owns cell, gap and content geometry. Selection,
input and rubber-band hit areas use the same content boundaries; gaps remain desktop background.
Preserve valid manual positions when capacity changes, fill free slots and defer capacity changes
during dragging. Reduced capacity hides excess items without deleting files; larger capacity
restores them. Capacity depends on scale, font, widgets and Dock space, not a fixed promised count.

In the VM, run `./tools/run-tests.sh --all`: `kos-deskcenter.density-metrics` checks geometry and
font bounds; `kos-deskcenter.density-runtime` checks the actual component with isolated fixture
items/state. These fixtures do not replace live desktop acceptance or touch real desktop files.
